\section{Future Directions}
\subsection{Adaptive sampling}
One interesting technique that can be used to great effect is adaptive sampling of light paths. Instead of using a fixed number of paths per pixel, it makes sense to prioritize the pixels with higher error, since they have a greater contribution to the total error. This is a form on importance sampling applied to differentiable rendering, and will serve top significantly speed up the optimization process, allowing for greater fidelity within the same time bounds.
