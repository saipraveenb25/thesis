% Big section. Main part of thesis.


\section{Practical differentiable rendering}
In this section, we discuss some of the practical considerations of the algorithm provided above.
These (fairly straightforward) modifications allow for fast and hassle-free optimization that might otherwiae be subject to numerical issues.
\subsection{Spherical projection}
Estimate projected gradients to speed up the 

\subsection{Pre-multiplication}
Multiply samples of the gradient tensor with the error image to form a sample of the gradient vector. This minimizes memory usage considerably since we no longer need storage for (WxHxN) elements.

\subsection{Set-Adaptive gradient descent}
